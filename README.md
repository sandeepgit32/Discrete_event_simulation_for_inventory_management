# Discrete_event_simulation_for_inventory_management

We consider an inventory of a retail shop. The quantity of the inventory is periodically checked so that if the quantity falls below reorder point (ROP), an order is placed. After placing the order, the delivery arrives at the retail shop after a certain delay. A customer arrives at the retail shop and purchase one or multiple products. If the product is out-of-stock, the customer leaves the retail shop dissatisfied.
